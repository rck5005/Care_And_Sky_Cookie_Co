TO DO BEFORE FINAL 

REQUIREMENTS:
user remove from favorites
user delete a user_cookie_creation
--previously purchased
--not previously purchased


just created a serializer for user while i was creating urls and views for user_cookie_creation.
might have to go back and change the user views since I didn't use a serializer for it. 

VALIDATIONS:

--models.py for: cookie_creation, cookie_cutter, deocration, flavor, topping, user_app

--views.py for: user_app, cookie_cutter_app, flavor_app, decoration_app, topping_app, user_cookie_creation
----user_cookie_creation(adjustfavorites, delete, if it's already deleted)




user can create user_cookie_creation
user_cookie_creation saves to cookie creation, but is automatically private
only way to make public is if the cookie creation was previously purchased

STRETCH GOAL: keep track of how many times the cookie was purchased


Front end: when user changes a creation from Favorite to Not Favorite, will need to identify if we should
remove the creation from users_cookie_creation views.py as well.
--perhaps ask the user if they'd also like to remove it from their creations?  and if so, then remove it
--and if it also has a "prev_purchased" of negative, then delete it from cookie creations also
