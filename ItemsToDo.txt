TO DO BEFORE FINAL 

REQUIREMENTS:
need to create an ADMIN account to be able track all creations and handle mailchimp info

need to create the "purchase" part of it so folks can buy their creations

thoughts:
fix favorites logic

when delete account on front end, ensure all user creations are deleted that weren't previously sold



lists.jsx line 193.
--currently creations/all/ "add to favorites" button doesn't display correctly, but you can add to favorites
-----issue is cookiecreation doesn't have "is_favorite", will need to 
-----compare each creation with the creations in the users "favorites" table and 
-----render the button that way.  

BACK END

VALIDATIONS:

--models.py for: cookie_creation, cookie_cutter, deocration, flavor, topping, user_app

--views.py for: user_app, cookie_cutter_app, flavor_app, decoration_app, topping_app, user_cookie_creation
----user_cookie_creation(adjustfavorites, delete, if it's already deleted)


user created cookie_creation needs to automatically save to user_cookie_creation as well, 
--it is automatically private (not previously purchased)
--only way to make public is to change previously purchased
--currently handled on front end by making two api calls in "YourCreationDisplay"


create admin user that can see ALL COOKIE CREATIONS with option to delete any of them
--right now we have some cookie creations that no one can see (previous users created cookie,
--then deleted account without purchasing)

STRETCH GOAL: keep track of how many times the cookie was purchased

STRETCH GOAL: refactor all calls in utilities.jsx to match mailchimp subscribe call with payload


FRONT END 

when user changes a creation from Favorite to Not Favorite, will need to ask user if we should
remove the creation from users_cookie_creation views.py as well.
--perhaps ask the user if they'd also like to remove it from their creations?  and if so, then remove it
--and if it also has a "prev_purchased" of negative, then delete it from cookie creations also

addremoveCreation.  going to be difficult. add another button to items only in "MyCookieCreations"
--option to either remove from list (if previously purchased) or 
--permanently delete (if it's user's creation)

Confirmation for Delete Account before deleting
--have user enter their current password to successfully delete their account

notify user when removing a variation from their potential creation, right now it just disappears

allow visibility of about page at all times whether logged in or logged out

create an alert if someone tries to create an account that is already taken

need to clear local storage when a user logs out so if another user logs in they don't have the
--same CREATION
----DID IT, but now i realize i might be able to save it to cookies somehow and
----somehow match it to the user name or something?


use hooks for mailchimp to track if someone is subscribed or not
--SignupPage, AccountPage (create the button that switches depending on what it is)

currently ListItems.css has a max-height of 3200px for each itme-card-container, when the list grows i'll need to update this

makecreation/
YourCreationDisplay.jsx
when clicking "Add New Creation" ensure at least a flavor and cookie cutter are selected
--also, after creation created, clear values of popup box
give option for user to clear all items at once with another submit button

DOWN THE ROAD: Handle all possible HTTP responses from the back end to front end.. right now just handling what is supposed to happen.


account page:
everything seems crunched together



FRONT END/BACK END
separate update username, address, and password:
--currently, when updating username, address or password it will try to update all three.
----AccountPage.jsx, utilities.jsx, user_app.views.py, user_app.urls

when user creates a new creation, i make two api calls, one to create the cookie_creation, the other to add
--it to the user's creations.
----in future perhaps add ability for cookie_creation to automatically update user_cooke_creation
----in the back end

when creating a user creation, give user option to immediately add to favorites

refactor to allow api/v1/users to handle signup/delete mailchimp account
--right now i'm making two calls from the pages to do this:
----two options, could consolidate in utilities.py (still making two api calls)
----second option is to utilize during the apicall from signup

need to sync up mailchimp and user account
especially on AccountPage when "subscribing", right now I just have the api delete the account
--and recreate




ITEMS COMPLETED:

BACK END


just created a serializer for user while i was creating urls and views for user_cookie_creation.
might have to go back and change the user views since I didn't use a serializer for it. 

FRONT END

user delete a user_cookie_creation
--previously purchased
--not previously purchased

save a users creation so if they refresh the page we don't lose the state

fix logout logic for update username
---just triggered a page reload

incorporated to confirm user they want to delete their profile:

login page and sign-up page
--have signup button more noticable



BACK END/FRONT END

ability for user to add address when signing up instead of changing it later
--signup page
